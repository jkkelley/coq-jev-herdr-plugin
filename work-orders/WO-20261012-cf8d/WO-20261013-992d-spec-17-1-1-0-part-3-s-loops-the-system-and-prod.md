## Problem

SPEC-17 1.1.0 (WO-20261013-bf48) was one large design ticket; under the size rule it lands one section per pull request on the same file, in order. This part writes card C26. Inputs: the bf48 scope (archived ticket WO-20261013-bf48), the parked draft $COQ_STATE/plans/2026/10/20261013021301-spec17-1-1-0-draft-loops-maintenance-controller.xml and the research $COQ_STATE/plans/2026/10/20261013021500-best-practices-agent-line.md; SPEC-16 sections cited by their per-file tickets under WO-20261012-5826.

## Scope

**In**

- s-loops: a ticket's loop by its top-level epic, two intake labels in SPEC-16.A, two capacity budgets in C linted against max_agents, no borrowing, routing by loop, the bootstrap during a drain

**Out - non-goals**

- building anything; builds are cut from the spec after the architect approves it (card C29)
- ROADMAP.md; additions there wait for the owner
- sections owned by the other SPEC-17 1.1.0 parts

## Degrees of freedom

- [fixed] None declared: implement exactly as specified; raise a question before deviating.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] `AC-H1` *(human)* make lint passes, the spec validates and stays under 1000 lines, and every pointer in the new section resolves
- [ ] `AC-H2` *(human)* the architect reads the section and approves it in the owner's place (card C29), with the record id in the pull request

## Test plan

```sh
make lint, in Podman through the repository target; the spec validates against spec.xsd and stays under 1000 lines
```

## Assumptions

_none_

## Open questions

_none_

## Notes

_Newest first. Appended only by `work-order note` - never by hand._

## Outcome

_Written by `work-order done`. Empty until then._
